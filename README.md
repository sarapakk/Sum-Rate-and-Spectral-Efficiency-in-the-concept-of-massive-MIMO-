# Sum-Rate-and-Spectral-Efficiency-in-the-concept-of-Massive-MIMO


In this project, the concept of sum rate and spectral efficiency in Massive MIMO (multiple-input, multiple-output) as a type of wireless communications technology is presented briefly.
The reference of this research is attached to this raprasetory. 

In addition, I have simulated some of the reference diagrams (Figures 10 and 11) to evaluate the fundamental concepts of this topic. 
Files that include codes of these two diagrams are attached too.

One of them, named "SumRate", shows the effect of the number of BS antennas on the sum rate for SINR=0 dB and the number of users equal to 16. This diagram also represents the value of the sum rate in comparison to Shannon's limit; Another file is "SpectralEfficiency", which is dedicated to analyzing the effect of changing the number of services on the total spectral efficiency at SINR= -6 dB, and for the number of users accepting these values: k = [16 32 64 128].
The report file shows the result of the simulation and mathematical analyses of results based on the mentioned reference.
